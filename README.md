Collection of beginner projects
English is my favorite language.
I have taken classes to learn Spanish,
I have not spoken the language since then.
Hi, I'm a person.
This is my first time on setting up a repository on Github.
I heard about it from an article that it was good to have
experience using this.
I liked learning python and Java, they were easy to understand.
However, Linux seems to be a bit more tedious. 
It reminds me of learning Spanish.
I like trying new things. 
I like cats and noisy caf√©s.
