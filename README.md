# hello-World
Collection of beginner projects









Greetings, I'm Kamari
This is my first time on Github.
I heard about it from an article that it was good to have
experience using this.
I liked learning python and Java, they were easy to understand.
However, Linux seems to be a bit more tedious.
I like trying new things. 
I like alligator nuggets and Ginger beer.
